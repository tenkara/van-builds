- **Floor deformation:** Do not exceed 1/8" sheet metal deformation

### Safety Requirements
- **Professional installation recommended**
- **Check for underfloor obstructions:**
  - Fuel tanks and fuel lines
  - Brake lines
  - Wiring and modules
  - Any other items that could be damaged
- **DANGER:** No unprotected bolts should point toward fuel system
  - Bolt ends must be permanently capped or shielded

5. **Seat mounting bolts:** 10 × HHS 1/2-20 × 1" (Grade 8)
6. **Split lock washers:** 10 × 1/2" split lock washer
7. **Flat washers:** 10 × 1/2" Grade 9 flat washer

## Dimensions for Layout Planning

### Estimated Sofa Dimensions
Based on installation instructions and typical foldaway seat designs:
- **Pod plate size:** Approximately 18-20"W × 26-30"L (estimated from diagrams)
- **Seat width (deployed):** Approximately 36-42"W (double seat)
- **Seat depth:** Approximately 18-20"D
- **Clearance required:** 6.5" minimum from driver side wall

### For Ford Transit 148" ELWB Layout
**Recommended positioning:**
- **Lateral position:** 6.5" minimum from driver (port) side wall
  - Driver wall at X=0", so pod starts at X=6.5" minimum
- **Longitudinal position:** As close to partition as practical
  - Allows maximum space for rear zones
- **Orientation:** Faces REAR (toward back of van)

## Installation Process Summary

1. **Position pod** on floor in desired location (6.5" from wall minimum)
2. **Check for obstructions** under floor
3. **Mark 7 hole locations** (6 required + 1 of 3 optional)
4. **Drill holes** with stop collar (9/16" × 12" long drill bit)
5. **Deburr and treat** hole edges with rust inhibitor
6. **Seal holes** from underneath
7. **Install 7 floor bolts** with washers and locknuts (30 ft-lb max)

## Key Notes for Our Build

### Advantages of FDFAAP System
- ✅ Flip-up design saves floor space when not in use
- ✅ Universal plate mount - easy to remove/relocate if needed
- ✅ Professional engineering with proper load testing
- ✅ Can be positioned precisely on driver side

### Installation Considerations
- [ ] Verify 6.5" clearance from driver wall is maintained
- [ ] Check for fuel tank position (Transit has fuel tank on driver side, Y=10-46")
- [ ] Professional installation required for bolt-through-floor mounting
- [ ] Ensure proper sealing to prevent moisture/fume infiltration
- [ ] Document installation for insurance purposes

### Clearance Calculation for Transit
- **Interior width at floor:** 68"
- **Minimum from driver wall:** 6.5"
- **Estimated pod width:** 20" (to be confirmed)
- **Pod position:** X = 6.5" to X = 26.5"
- **Remaining aisle width:** 68" - 26.5" = 41.5" ✅

## Recommended Tools
- Drill with stop collar
- 9/16" × 12" long drill bit
- Small diameter drill bit (pilot holes)
- Ratchet
- 5/16" hex driver or Allen key
