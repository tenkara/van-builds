- **Interior Width:** Similar to Transit at ~70" at beltline

### Unknown/Not Published
The following dimensions were NOT found in public sources:
- Exact wet bath floor dimensions
- Shower floor size when deployed
- Galley counter depth (estimated 20-24")
- Cabinet heights
- Specific zone boundary measurements
- Bed platform dimensions
- Aisle width measurements

## Design Elements to Adopt for Transit 148" ELWB

### 1. Hideaway Wet Bath Concept
- **Benefit:** Maximizes space efficiency
- **Implementation:** Counter that lifts/converts to reveal shower
- **Key Feature:** Avoid placing shower over wheel well
- **Clearance:** Ensure 24" minimum for sliding door entrance

### 2. Galley Kitchen Layout
- **Refrigerator:** Front-opening design (similar to our 90L plan)
- **Counter Depth:** Estimated 20-24" based on standard van layouts
- **Sink Position:** Integrated into convertible counter or adjacent to fridge
- **Dual Use:** Counter space doubles as bathroom vanity when closed

### 3. Space Optimization
- **Priority Zones:** Bed, shower/toilet, kitchen, fridge, sofa (in order)
- **Optional Zones:** Transition space, Lagun table area (eliminate if space constrained)
- **Dual Purpose:** Every surface should serve multiple functions

## Notes for Our Transit Layout

### Constraints
- **Usable Length:** 155" (20" shorter than Sprinter 170")
- **Wheel Wells:** Y=79" to Y=114" (35" long, 8" protrusion each side)
- **Sliding Door:** Passenger side, requires 24" minimum clearance for entry
- **Available Space:** Between sofa end (Y=28") and wheel well start (Y=79") = 51"

### Design Strategy
1. Work backwards from Y=155" (rear door)
2. Bed platform: Push to rear (Y=155")
3. Transition: Eliminate if needed to gain space
4. Wet bath + Galley: Must fit BEFORE wheel wells (Y=28" to Y=79")
5. Ensure 24" clearance at sliding door entrance
6. Sofa: Position per manufacturer installation requirements (close to driver wall/front)

### Key Decisions Needed
- [ ] Exact wet bath width (26" or reduce to 24"?)
- [ ] Galley counter depth (22" or reduce to 20"?)
- [ ] Bed height optimization (consider windows, garage access, bed access)
- [ ] Shower floor dimensions (need to estimate based on similar conversions)
- [ ] Toilet placement strategy (slide-out vs fixed position)
