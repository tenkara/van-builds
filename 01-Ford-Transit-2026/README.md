# Ford Transit 2026 - Camper Van Conversion Project

## Project Overview
This folder contains all planning, documentation, and resources for converting a 2026 Ford Transit cargo van into a custom camper van.

## Folder Structure

```
01-Ford-Transit-2026/
├── 01-plans/          # Build plans, design documents, layouts, and specifications
├── 02-prompts/        # AI prompts and queries used during planning
├── 03-inputs/         # Source materials, measurements, requirements, inspiration
├── 04-outputs/        # Generated designs, renders, calculations, and deliverables
└── 05-scripts/        # Automation scripts, calculators, and tools
```

## File Naming Convention

Files within each subfolder should follow this versioning pattern:
- Format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-descriptive-name.ext`
- Example: `20260220-1430-initial-layout-plan.md`

This allows for:
- Chronological tracking of project evolution
- Easy identification of latest versions
- Clear audit trail of decisions and changes

## Usage

1. **01-plans/**: Store floor plans, electrical diagrams, plumbing layouts, build sequences
2. **02-prompts/**: Save prompts used with AI tools for reproducibility
3. **03-inputs/**: Van dimensions, budget constraints, feature requirements, reference images
4. **04-outputs/**: Final designs, shopping lists, cost estimates, 3D models
5. **05-scripts/**: Python/bash scripts for calculations, material optimization, etc.
